Recursive runtime
A recursive algorithm calls itself which usually passes the return value as a parameter to the algorithm again. 
This parameter is the input while the return value is the output.
Recursive algorithm is a method of simplification that divides the problem into subproblems of the same nature. 
The result of one recursion is the input for the next recursion.The replacement is in the self-similar fashion.
The algorithm calls itself with smaller input values and obtains the results by simply performing the operations on these smaller values.
Generation of factorial, Fibonacci number series are the examples of recursive algorithms.

SPACE COMPLEXITY
Space complexity is the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program including space of input values for execution and production.
Because a program requires memory to store input data and temporal values while running,the space complexity is auxiliary input space.
A good algorithm executes quickly and saves space in the process.
Space complexity also helps the developer to know about the worst case of the algorithm so as to improve that algorithm to perform the worst case also.

The best algorithm should have low level of space complexity less space required, the faster it executes.

Auxiliary space -> Extra space used by the algorithm during execution 
Space complexity = Auxillary Space+Input Space

Memory Usage while Execution
     1  Instruction space
Amount of memory used to save the compile version of instructions.
    2. Environmental Stack
An algorithm(function) may be called inside another algorithm(function). Such a situation, current variables are pushed onto the system stack while they wait for further execution and then a call to the inside algorithm(function) is made.
      3.Data Space
Amount of space used by the variables and constants.

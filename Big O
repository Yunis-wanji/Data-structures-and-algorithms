What is Big O
The Big O is simply a way to test how fast as well as how efficient an algorithm is. 
The key number of of opertaions required by the algorithm.

Algorithm are the step series taken towradssolving a given problem.

Big O is essentially measuring the rate of growth in time for algorithm with reference to size of input.

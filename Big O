What is Big O
The Big O is simply a way to test how fast as well as how efficient an algorithm is. 
The key number of of opertaions required by the algorithm.

Algorithm are the step series taken towrads solving a given problem.
Using O-notation, you can describe how the running time and the required memory of an algorithm increase with the size of the input, as the size of the input grows 
without bound.

Big O is essentially measuring the rate of growth in time for algorithm with reference to size of input.

The complexity can also be expalined as the best, average, worst case expected.
The Big O notation works with the worst case scenario of any given algorithm
